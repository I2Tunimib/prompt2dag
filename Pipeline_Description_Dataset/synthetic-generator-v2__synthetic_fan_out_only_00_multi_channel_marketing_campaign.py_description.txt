[multi_channel_marketing_campaign] - Comprehensive Pipeline Description

Opening Summary:
This pipeline executes a multi-channel marketing campaign by loading customer segment data and triggering parallel email, SMS, and push notification campaigns. The topology follows a fan-out pattern where a single data loading task triggers three independent marketing channel executions without synchronization. Key infrastructure features include PythonOperator-based task execution, daily scheduling, and basic retry policies without sensor dependencies or external DAG triggers.

Pipeline Steps:

1. load_customer_segment_csv
  • Objective: Load customer segmentation data to enable targeted multi-channel marketing campaigns
  • Technical Details:
    - Input: Customer segment CSV file (inferred from function logic)
    - Output: Loaded customer records with segmentation data (premium, regular, new segments)
    - Integrations: Local file system for CSV data
    - Key Parameters: 1,500 customer records processed with email, phone, and device_token columns
  • Operator or Mechanism: PythonOperator
  • Notes: Initial data preparation step that enables all downstream marketing channels

2. send_email_campaign
  • Objective: Execute email marketing campaign targeting premium customer segment
  • Technical Details:
    - Input: Customer segment data from load_customer_segment_csv
    - Output: Email campaign execution results
    - Integrations: Email delivery system (inferred from function purpose)
    - Key Parameters: Targets 500 customers with "Special Offer for Premium Customers" template
  • Operator or Mechanism: PythonOperator
  • Notes: Runs in parallel with SMS and push notification campaigns

3. send_sms_campaign
  • Objective: Execute SMS marketing campaign with exclusive deals
  • Technical Details:
    - Input: Customer segment data from load_customer_segment_csv
    - Output: SMS campaign execution results
    - Integrations: SMS delivery gateway (inferred from function purpose)
    - Key Parameters: Targets 800 customers with "Exclusive Deal - Limited Time!" template
  • Operator or Mechanism: PythonOperator
  • Notes: Runs in parallel with email and push notification campaigns

4. send_push_notification
  • Objective: Execute push notification campaign for mobile app users
  • Technical Details:
    - Input: Customer segment data from load_customer_segment_csv
    - Output: Push notification campaign execution results
    - Integrations: Mobile push notification service (inferred from function purpose)
    - Key Parameters: Targets 200 mobile app users with "Don't miss out on our latest offer!" message
  • Operator or Mechanism: PythonOperator
  • Notes: Runs in parallel with email and SMS campaigns

Orchestration & Scheduling:
- Schedule: @daily
- Start Date: 2024-01-01
- Catchup: False
- Default Args: owner=marketing_team, depends_on_past=False, retries=2, retry_delay=5 minutes, email_on_failure=False, email_on_retry=False

Infrastructure & Dependencies:
- Task grouping: No TaskGroups used
- Connections/IDs: No explicit connection IDs or pools configured
- Data I/O hints: CSV file with customer_id, segment, email, phone, device_token columns
- Parallel execution: Three independent marketing channels (email, SMS, push notifications)

Failure Handling & Alerts:
- Retry Policy: 2 retries with 5-minute delay between attempts
- Email Alerts: Disabled for both failures and retries (email_on_failure=False, email_on_retry=False)
- No failure triggers or special trigger rules configured

Pattern-Specific Notes:
- Fan-out pattern with parallel width of 3 marketing channels
- No fan-in/synchronization - campaigns run independently after data loading
- Pre-processing stage: load_customer_segment_csv prepares data for all channels
- Parallel segment: Three marketing channels execute concurrently without dependencies on each other
- No join stage - campaigns complete independently without aggregation or synchronization
