# Healthcare Claims Processing ETL Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a staged ETL pattern for healthcare claims processing, designed to extract patient claims and provider data from CSV sources, transform and enrich the data through joining and anonymization processes, and load results to an analytics warehouse while refreshing business intelligence dashboards. The pipeline demonstrates a hybrid flow pattern with parallel extraction followed by sequential transformation and parallel loading/notification stages. Key architectural characteristics include component-level retry policies, structured data lineage tracking, and integration with multiple external systems including filesystem sources, database warehouses, and BI platform APIs.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a hybrid flow pattern combining sequential and parallel execution models. Initial data extraction occurs in parallel, followed by a synchronization point for data transformation, and concluding with parallel loading and notification operations.

### Execution Characteristics
All pipeline components utilize Python-based executors with consistent configuration patterns. No specialized execution environments or resource constraints are specified.

### Component Overview
The pipeline consists of five distinct components organized into functional categories:
- **Extractor** (2 components): Responsible for sourcing data from CSV files
- **Transformer** (1 component): Handles data joining, anonymization, and enrichment
- **Loader** (1 component): Manages data persistence to analytics warehouse
- **Notifier** (1 component): Coordinates BI dashboard refresh operations

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with two parallel entry points (extract_claims and extract_providers) that feed into a central transformation component (transform_join). The transformed data then flows to two parallel endpoints: load_warehouse for data persistence and refresh_bi for dashboard updates.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Extract Claims Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Extracts patient claims data from CSV source file
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: claims.csv file (filesystem)
- **Outputs**: extracted_claims_data object
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Local filesystem connection for CSV input

### Extract Providers Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Extracts healthcare provider data from CSV source file
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: providers.csv file (filesystem)
- **Outputs**: extracted_providers_data object
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Local filesystem connection for CSV input

### Transform and Join Claims with Providers (Transformer)
- **Purpose**: Joins claims and provider data, anonymizes PII, and calculates risk scores
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: extracted_claims_data and extracted_providers_data objects
- **Outputs**: transformed_claims_with_providers object
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: No direct external system connections

### Load Data to Analytics Warehouse (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Loads transformed data to healthcare_analytics.claims_fact and healthcare_analytics.providers_dim tables
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: transformed_claims_with_providers object
- **Outputs**: warehouse_loaded_status object, claims_fact_table, providers_dim_table
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: PostgreSQL database connection

### Refresh BI Dashboards (Notifier)
- **Purpose**: Refreshes Power BI and Tableau dashboards with updated data
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: warehouse_loaded_status object
- **Outputs**: bi_refresh_status object
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Power BI API and Tableau API connections

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-Level Parameters
- **name**: "healthcare_claims_etl" (default)
- **description**: Comprehensive healthcare claims processing ETL pipeline implementing a staged ETL pattern
- **tags**: healthcare, etl, staged_etl, claims_processing

### Schedule Configuration
- **enabled**: true
- **cron_expression**: @daily
- **start_date**: 2024-01-01T00:00:00
- **catchup**: false
- **partitioning**: daily

### Execution Settings
- **max_active_runs**: 1
- **retry_policy**: 2 retries with 5-minute delay

### Component-Specific Parameters
- **extract_claims**: source_file parameter for claims CSV path
- **extract_providers**: source_file parameter for providers CSV path
- **transform_join**: anonymize_pii and calculate_risk_scores boolean flags
- **load_warehouse**: target_schema, claims_table, and providers_table parameters
- **refresh_bi**: bi_tools array parameter

### Environment Variables
- **DATA_SOURCE_PATH**: Base path for input CSV files
- **WAREHOUSE_CONN_ID**: Connection ID for analytics warehouse
- **POWER_BI_CONN_ID**: Connection ID for Power BI service
- **TABLEAU_CONN_ID**: Connection ID for Tableau service

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- **Filesystem Connections**: Claims and providers CSV source files
- **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL analytics warehouse
- **API Connections**: Power BI and Tableau refresh endpoints

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Sources**: Local CSV files containing patient claims and healthcare provider data
- **Sinks**: PostgreSQL database tables and BI dashboard refresh endpoints

### Authentication Methods
- **Filesystem**: No authentication
- **Database**: Basic authentication using environment variables
- **APIs**: OAuth (Power BI) and token-based (Tableau) authentication

### Data Lineage
The pipeline maintains clear data lineage from source CSV files through intermediate transformation stages to final warehouse tables and BI dashboards. Intermediate datasets include raw claims and providers data, joined datasets, and anonymized results with risk scores.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity with a well-structured staged ETL pattern. The hybrid flow model effectively utilizes parallel processing where appropriate while maintaining necessary sequential dependencies for data integrity.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components except initial extractors require all upstream successes. Initial extraction tasks run independently at pipeline start.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Consistent retry policies across all components with 2 maximum attempts and 300-second delays. No component-level timeout configurations specified.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Rate limiting on BI API connections may impact refresh operations under high load
- Lack of specialized resource allocation may affect performance with large datasets
- No explicit error handling for data quality issues in transformation stage

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### General Assessment
The pipeline structure is compatible with major orchestrator platforms including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The component-based design and clear dependency management align well with orchestrator-neutral execution models.

### Pattern-Specific Considerations
- **Parallel Execution**: Well-suited for orchestrators supporting concurrent task execution
- **Parameter Management**: Standard parameter schema compatible with most orchestrator systems
- **Retry Handling**: Component-level retry policies can be mapped to orchestrator retry mechanisms
- **Data Exchange**: Object-based data passing aligns with XCom or similar inter-task communication patterns

## 8. Conclusion

This healthcare claims processing pipeline demonstrates a well-architected ETL solution with clear separation of concerns across extraction, transformation, loading, and notification stages. The hybrid execution model effectively balances parallel processing opportunities with necessary sequential dependencies. The consistent parameter schema, retry policies, and integration patterns provide a solid foundation for deployment across various orchestrator platforms. The pipeline's modular design and structured data lineage make it maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
