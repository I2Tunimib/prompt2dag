# Backup Strategy Selector Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a branch-merge pattern for automated database backup strategy selection based on the day of the week. The workflow routes execution to either a full backup process (executed on Saturdays) or an incremental backup process (executed on weekdays), then converges to a common verification step. The pipeline demonstrates conditional execution patterns with two distinct processing paths that merge into a single completion point.

The overall flow consists of 6 components arranged in a sequential pattern with a single branching decision point. The complexity is moderate, primarily due to the conditional routing logic and merge synchronization requirements.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential flow pattern with one branching decision point. The architecture follows a clear branch-merge topology where execution splits based on day-of-week determination and converges at a verification step.

### Execution Characteristics
Two executor types are utilized:
- Python executor for orchestration and decision-making tasks
- Bash executor for simulation of backup operations

### Component Overview
The pipeline consists of 6 components across 4 categories:
- **Orchestrator (2)**: Workflow initialization and completion markers
- **Splitter (1)**: Conditional routing based on execution date
- **Loader (2)**: Backup execution tasks (full and incremental)
- **QualityCheck (1)**: Backup verification process

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with a single entry point (start_backup_process) that leads to a branching decision node (date_check_task). This component routes execution to either full_backup_task or incremental_backup_task based on the day of the week. Both paths converge at verify_backup_task, which then leads to the final completion marker (backup_complete).

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Start Backup Process (Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Initialize the backup workflow as a starting point
- **Executor**: Python executor with minimal resource allocation (0.1 CPU, 128Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: No inputs or outputs; serves as workflow entry point
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Date Check Task (Splitter)
- **Purpose**: Determine backup strategy by checking day of week (Saturday vs weekdays)
- **Executor**: Python executor with entry_point "check_day_of_week" (0.2 CPU, 256Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Accepts execution_date as input; routes to appropriate backup path
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Full Backup Task (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Perform complete database backup (executed only on Saturdays)
- **Executor**: Bash executor running "sleep 5" command (0.5 CPU, 512Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Produces "full_backup" dataset; no inputs
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Incremental Backup Task (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Perform partial backup of changed data only (executed on weekdays)
- **Executor**: Bash executor running "sleep 3" command (0.3 CPU, 256Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Produces "incremental_backup" dataset; no inputs
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Verify Backup Task (QualityCheck)
- **Purpose**: Validate backup integrity and completeness after either backup type
- **Executor**: Bash executor running "echo Backup verification complete" (0.2 CPU, 128Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Consumes both "full_backup" and "incremental_backup" datasets; produces "backup_verification" dataset
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Backup Complete (Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Mark backup workflow completion
- **Executor**: Python executor with minimal resource allocation (0.1 CPU, 128Mi memory)
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Consumes "backup_verification" dataset; no outputs
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and system errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-Level Parameters
- **name**: "backup_strategy_selector" (string)

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
No external system connections are defined in this pipeline.

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Sources**: DAG trigger initiating backup process, execution date context for day-of-week determination
- **Sinks**: Workflow completion marker
- **Intermediate Datasets**: Full backup simulation result, incremental backup simulation result, backup verification result

### Authentication Methods
No authentication methods are specified.

### Data Lineage
The pipeline maintains clear data lineage from initiation through branching execution paths to final verification and completion.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity with a clear branch-merge pattern. The primary complexity lies in the conditional routing logic and merge synchronization.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components except the initial task require "all_success" upstream policy. The verification task uses "none_failed" policy to accommodate both backup paths.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
All components share consistent retry policies with maximum 2 attempts and 300-second delays. No component-level timeouts are specified.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- The pipeline lacks actual backup implementation, relying on sleep commands for simulation
- No external system integrations are defined
- Email notification capabilities exist but are disabled by default

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

This pipeline design is compatible with major workflow orchestrators including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The branch-merge pattern with conditional execution paths and trigger rule variations are supported across these platforms. The resource allocation specifications and retry policies can be mapped to equivalent constructs in each orchestrator.

The pattern-specific considerations include:
- Conditional branching logic requires appropriate conditional execution capabilities
- Trigger rule variations need equivalent support in the target orchestrator
- Resource allocation specifications may need translation to orchestrator-specific formats

## 8. Conclusion

The Backup Strategy Selector pipeline demonstrates a well-structured branch-merge pattern for conditional execution based on temporal criteria. The design effectively separates concerns between orchestration, decision-making, execution, and verification components. The consistent retry policies and clear data lineage make this pipeline robust and maintainable. The modular component design allows for easy extension or modification of individual backup strategies while maintaining the overall workflow integrity.
