# Procurement Supplier Validation Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline performs data validation and standardization for supplier information by reconciling supplier names against Wikidata. The process ingests supplier data in CSV format, transforms and enriches it through sequential processing steps, and outputs a validated dataset in CSV format.

The pipeline follows a linear, sequential execution pattern with three distinct components, each handling a specific phase of data processing. The overall complexity is moderate, with straightforward data flow and minimal branching or parallel processing requirements.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential execution pattern where each component must complete successfully before the next begins. No branching, parallel processing, or sensor-based triggering mechanisms are present.

### Execution Characteristics
All components utilize Docker container execution with HTTP-based API integrations. Each component runs in isolated containers connected through a shared Docker network.

### Component Overview
- **Extractor**: Ingests and transforms raw supplier CSV data to standardized JSON format
- **Reconciliator**: Matches supplier names with Wikidata entities for data validation
- **Loader**: Exports validated data to final CSV format

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with the Load and Modify Supplier Data component, which processes the initial CSV file. Its output feeds into the Wikidata reconciliation component, which produces enriched JSON data. Finally, the Save Final Supplier Data component converts this enriched data to CSV format for export.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Component 1: Load and Modify Supplier Data (Extractor)
**Purpose**: Ingests supplier CSV data, standardizes formats, and converts to JSON structure.

**Executor Configuration**: 
- Type: Docker container execution
- Image: i2t-backendwithintertwino6-load-and-modify:latest
- Network: app_network
- Environment Variables: DATASET_ID=2, TABLE_NAME_PREFIX=JOT_

**Inputs/Outputs**:
- Input: suppliers.csv (file, CSV format) from ${DATA_DIR}/suppliers.csv
- Output: table_data_2.json (file, JSON format) to ${DATA_DIR}/table_data_2.json

**Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retrying on timeouts and network errors
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution support

**Connected Systems**: Filesystem volume for data directory access, Intertwino API integration

### Component 2: Reconcile Supplier Names with Wikidata (Reconciliator)
**Purpose**: Disambiguates supplier names using Wikidata API to establish canonical entity references.

**Executor Configuration**: 
- Type: Docker container execution
- Image: i2t-backendwithintertwino6-reconciliation:latest
- Network: app_network
- Environment Variables: PRIMARY_COLUMN=supplier_name, RECONCILIATOR_ID=wikidataEntity, DATASET_ID=2

**Inputs/Outputs**:
- Input: table_data_2.json (file, JSON format) from ${DATA_DIR}/table_data_2.json
- Output: reconciled_table_2.json (file, JSON format) to ${DATA_DIR}/reconciled_table_2.json

**Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retrying on timeouts and network errors
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution support

**Connected Systems**: Filesystem volume for data directory access, Wikidata API service

### Component 3: Save Final Supplier Data (Loader)
**Purpose**: Exports validated supplier data to CSV format for downstream consumption.

**Executor Configuration**: 
- Type: Docker container execution
- Image: i2t-backendwithintertwino6-save:latest
- Network: app_network
- Environment Variables: DATASET_ID=2

**Inputs/Outputs**:
- Input: reconciled_table_2.json (file, JSON format) from ${DATA_DIR}/reconciled_table_2.json
- Output: enriched_data_2.csv (file, CSV format) to ${DATA_DIR}/enriched_data_2.csv

**Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retrying on timeouts and network errors
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution support

**Connected Systems**: Filesystem volume for data directory access, Save service API

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-Level Parameters
- **name**: String identifier "procurement_supplier_validation"
- **description**: Text description of validation and standardization process
- **tags**: Array of classification tags ["procurement", "supplier-data", "wikidata", "data-validation"]

### Schedule Configuration
No explicit scheduling configuration defined. Supports standard scheduling parameters including cron expressions, start/end dates, timezone specification, and catchup behavior.

### Execution Settings
Supports configuration of maximum concurrent runs, execution timeouts, pipeline-level retry policies, and dependency on previous run success.

### Component-Specific Parameters
- **Load Component**: DATASET_ID (integer, required), TABLE_NAME_PREFIX (string)
- **Reconcile Component**: PRIMARY_COLUMN (string, required), RECONCILIATOR_ID (string, required), DATASET_ID (integer, required)
- **Save Component**: DATASET_ID (integer, required)

### Environment Variables
- **DATA_DIR**: Required directory path for shared data access across components

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- Filesystem volume mounting for shared data directory access
- Wikidata API for entity reconciliation services
- Intertwino API for load-and-modify service integration
- Save service API for final data export

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Source**: suppliers.csv file in shared data directory
- **Sink**: enriched_data_2.csv file in shared data directory
- **Intermediate Datasets**: JSON files for data transformation between components

### Authentication Methods
No explicit authentication methods defined in component configurations.

### Data Lineage
Data flows from CSV source through JSON transformation stages to final CSV output, with Wikidata entity reconciliation providing data enrichment during processing.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
Low to moderate complexity with straightforward sequential processing. No conditional branching or complex parallel processing patterns present.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components follow an "all_success" upstream policy, requiring successful completion of previous steps before execution.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Uniform retry policy across all components with single retry attempt after 30-second delay for timeout and network error conditions. No explicit timeout configurations defined.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Single retry attempt may not be sufficient for transient network issues with Wikidata API
- Sequential processing limits throughput optimization opportunities
- No explicit error handling or data validation beyond component-level failures
- Dependency on external Wikidata service availability

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### General Assessment
Pipeline structure is compatible with major workflow orchestration platforms including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. Sequential execution pattern maps directly to standard task dependencies in all platforms.

### Pattern-Specific Considerations
- Simple sequential pattern requires minimal orchestration complexity
- Docker executor support available in all major platforms
- File-based data exchange compatible with shared volume configurations
- Retry policies can be implemented at platform level or component level

## 8. Conclusion

This pipeline provides a well-defined, sequential data processing workflow for supplier data validation and standardization. The three-component architecture effectively separates concerns between data ingestion, reconciliation, and export functions. While the implementation is straightforward, the dependency on external Wikidata services and limited retry mechanisms represent potential areas for enhancement. The pipeline's modular design and clear data flow make it suitable for deployment across various orchestration platforms with minimal modification.
