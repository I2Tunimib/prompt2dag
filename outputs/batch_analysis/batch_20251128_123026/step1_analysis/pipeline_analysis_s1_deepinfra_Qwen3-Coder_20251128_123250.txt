# Procurement Supplier Validation Pipeline Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline performs data validation and enrichment for procurement supplier information. It ingests raw supplier data from CSV, standardizes the format, reconciles supplier names against Wikidata for canonical entity identification, and exports the enriched data back to CSV. The pipeline follows a strictly sequential execution pattern with three distinct processing stages. The overall complexity is moderate, with each component relying on external APIs and shared filesystem access for data exchange.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential execution pattern with no branching, parallel processing, or sensor-based triggering mechanisms. Each component executes only after successful completion of its immediate upstream component.

### Execution Characteristics
All components utilize Docker container executors with consistent resource allocation (1 CPU, 2Gi memory). No HTTP executor instances are configured in the current implementation.

### Component Overview
- **Extractor** (1): Ingests and transforms raw supplier CSV data to JSON format
- **Reconciliator** (1): Matches supplier names with Wikidata entities for data validation
- **Loader** (1): Exports validated data to final CSV format

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with the "Load and Modify Supplier Data" component, which processes the initial CSV input. Upon successful completion, it triggers the "Reconcile Supplier Names with Wikidata" component. Finally, the "Save Final Supplier Data" component executes to produce the enriched output CSV. No parallel execution paths or conditional branching exists.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Load and Modify Supplier Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Ingests supplier CSV data, standardizes formats, and converts to JSON
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-load-and-modify:latest"
- **Inputs**: suppliers.csv file (CSV format)
- **Outputs**: table_data_2.json file (JSON format)
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Shared filesystem volume, Intertwino API service

### Reconcile Supplier Names with Wikidata (Reconciliator)
- **Purpose**: Disambiguates supplier names using Wikidata API to find canonical entities
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-reconciliation:latest"
- **Inputs**: table_data_2.json file (JSON format)
- **Outputs**: reconciled_table_2.json file (JSON format)
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Shared filesystem volume, Wikidata API service

### Save Final Supplier Data (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Exports validated supplier data to CSV format
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-save:latest"
- **Inputs**: reconciled_table_2.json file (JSON format)
- **Outputs**: enriched_data_2.csv file (CSV format)
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay, retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Shared filesystem volume, Save service API

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-level Parameters
No pipeline-level parameters are defined.

### Schedule Configuration
No scheduling configuration is specified.

### Execution Settings
No specific execution settings are defined beyond component-level configurations.

### Component-specific Parameters
- Load component: DATASET_ID=2, TABLE_NAME_PREFIX=JOT_
- Reconcile component: PRIMARY_COLUMN=supplier_name, RECONCILIATOR_ID=wikidataEntity, DATASET_ID=2
- Save component: DATASET_ID=2

### Environment Variables
The DATA_DIR environment variable is used for shared filesystem access across all components.

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- Shared filesystem for data exchange between components
- Wikidata API for entity reconciliation
- Intertwino backend API for service integration
- Custom Docker network for component communication
- MongoDB instance (configured but not actively used by components)

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Source**: suppliers.csv file containing basic supplier information
- **Sink**: enriched_data_2.csv file with validated and standardized supplier data
- **Intermediate Datasets**: table_data_2.json, reconciled_table_2.json

### Authentication Methods
All connections use no authentication mechanisms.

### Data Lineage
Raw supplier data flows through JSON transformation, Wikidata reconciliation, and final CSV export with clear data provenance between stages.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline has moderate complexity with straightforward sequential processing. The main complexity arises from external API dependencies and data format transformations.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components follow an "all_success" upstream policy, requiring successful completion of preceding components before execution.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Each component is configured with a single retry attempt and 30-second delay for timeout and network error scenarios. No exponential backoff is implemented.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Single retry attempts may not adequately handle transient failures
- Wikidata API dependency introduces external service risk
- No explicit timeout configurations may lead to hanging processes
- Lack of parallelism may impact processing efficiency for large datasets

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### Assessment for Major Platforms
The pipeline's sequential pattern and Docker-based execution are compatible with Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster orchestrators. The component structure maps well to task-based execution models.

### Pattern-specific Considerations
The linear execution flow simplifies orchestration implementation. The consistent Docker executor usage provides uniform deployment characteristics. The lack of sensors or dynamic branching reduces complexity but may limit adaptability to variable data conditions.

## 8. Conclusion

This pipeline effectively addresses supplier data validation through a well-defined three-stage process. The sequential architecture ensures data consistency and clear error tracing. While the implementation is straightforward, consideration should be given to enhancing retry mechanisms and implementing more robust error handling for production deployment. The modular component design facilitates maintenance and potential future enhancements.
