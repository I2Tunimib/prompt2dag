# Executive Sales Dashboard Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a sensor-gated workflow that waits for completion of an upstream daily sales aggregation process before loading aggregated sales data and generating an executive dashboard. The pipeline follows a linear sequential pattern with an initial sensor component that acts as a gate for downstream processing.

The workflow demonstrates moderate complexity through its dependency management pattern, utilizing a sensor-driven architecture to ensure proper data availability before processing begins. The pipeline consists of three main components: a sensor gate, data loading/validation task, and dashboard generation task.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential execution pattern with sensor-driven initiation. The flow begins with a sensor component that monitors external process completion, followed by linear task execution without branching or parallel processing.

### Execution Characteristics
All components utilize Python-based execution environments with standardized retry configurations. The sensor component employs a reschedule mode to optimize resource utilization during waiting periods.

### Component Overview
- **Sensor Component**: Monitors completion status of external daily sales aggregation process
- **Loader Component**: Loads and validates aggregated sales CSV data files
- **Transformer Component**: Generates executive dashboard from validated sales data

### Flow Description
The pipeline entry point is the sensor component that monitors external process completion. Upon successful detection, execution proceeds sequentially through data loading and dashboard generation tasks. No branching, parallelism, or additional sensors are present in the workflow.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Wait for Sales Aggregation (Sensor)
**Purpose and Category**: Gates pipeline execution until upstream daily sales aggregation process completes successfully  
**Executor Type**: Python-based sensor with reschedule mode  
**Inputs**: External DAG completion status from daily_sales_aggregation process

**Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delays, retrying on timeouts and network errors  
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution capabilities  
**Connected Systems**: Orchestrator monitoring system for external DAG status  

### Load Sales CSV (Loader)
**Purpose and Category**: Loads and validates aggregated sales CSV data produced by upstream processes  
**Executor Type**: Python-based loader with file processing capabilities  
**Inputs**: Aggregated sales CSV files following pattern /data/sales/aggregated_{{ ds }}.csv  
**Outputs**: Validated sales data objects for downstream consumption  
**Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delays, retrying on file not found and validation errors  
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution capabilities  
**Connected Systems**: Filesystem storage for CSV data access  

### Generate Executive Dashboard (Transformer)
**Purpose and Category**: Creates executive dashboard with sales metrics and visualizations from validated sales data  
**Executor Type**: Python-based transformer for dashboard generation  
**Inputs**: Validated sales data objects from loader component  
**Outputs**: Dashboard files following pattern /dashboards/executive_{{ ds }}.html  
**Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delays, retrying on rendering and data processing errors  
**Concurrency**: No parallel execution capabilities  
**Connected Systems**: Filesystem storage for dashboard output

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity through its sensor-gated architecture and dependency management. The linear sequential flow with standardized retry policies provides predictable execution behavior.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
The sensor component implements a "none failed" policy with 3600-second timeout for external process monitoring. Downstream components require successful completion of immediate upstream components.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
All components implement consistent retry policies with maximum 2 attempts and 300-second delays. The sensor component includes specific timeout handling for external process monitoring.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Single point of failure at the sensor component
- Dependency on external process completion within timeout window
- Sequential execution may impact overall pipeline duration
- File-based storage introduces potential I/O bottlenecks

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### Assessment for Major Platforms
The pipeline architecture is compatible with major workflow orchestration platforms including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The sensor-driven pattern and sequential execution model translate well across different orchestration systems.

### Pattern-Specific Considerations
The external process monitoring pattern requires platform-specific implementations but maintains consistent behavioral characteristics. The reschedule mode for sensor components may have varying implementations across platforms but preserves the underlying resource optimization intent.

## 8. Conclusion

This pipeline successfully implements a reliable, sensor-gated workflow for executive dashboard generation based on upstream sales aggregation processes. The architecture ensures proper data availability through dependency monitoring while maintaining predictable execution patterns. The standardized component configurations and retry policies provide robust error handling, and the linear flow simplifies monitoring and troubleshooting. The design demonstrates good separation of concerns with distinct sensor, loading, and transformation components, each with clearly defined responsibilities and integration points.
