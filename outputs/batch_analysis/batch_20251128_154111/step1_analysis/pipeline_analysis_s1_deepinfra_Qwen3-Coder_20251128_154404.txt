# Procurement Supplier Validation Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline is designed to enhance procurement data quality by validating and standardizing supplier information. It ingests raw supplier CSV data, reconciles supplier names against Wikidata for canonical identification, and exports the enriched data in a standardized format.

The pipeline follows a sequential execution pattern with three distinct stages: data loading and transformation, entity reconciliation, and final data export. All components execute within Docker containers and share data through a common filesystem volume. The process demonstrates moderate complexity with external API dependencies and structured error handling mechanisms.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential execution pattern where each component must complete successfully before the next begins. No branching, parallel execution, or sensor-based triggering mechanisms are present.

### Execution Characteristics
All pipeline components utilize Docker container executors with HTTP-based API integrations. Components share a common Docker network and access data through a mounted filesystem volume.

### Component Overview
- **Extractor (1)**: Transforms raw supplier CSV data into standardized JSON format
- **Reconciliator (1)**: Matches supplier names with Wikidata entities for validation
- **Loader (1)**: Exports validated data to final CSV format

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with the data loading component, which processes supplier CSV files. Upon successful completion, it triggers the Wikidata reconciliation process. Finally, the validated data is exported to CSV format. Each component requires successful completion of its predecessor.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Load and Modify Supplier Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Ingests supplier CSV files, standardizes data formats, and converts to JSON
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-load-and-modify:latest"
- **Inputs**: suppliers.csv file from shared data directory
- **Outputs**: table_data_2.json file to shared data directory
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay; retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Filesystem volume, Intertwino API, MongoDB database

### Reconcile Supplier Names with Wikidata (Reconciliator)
- **Purpose**: Disambiguates supplier names using Wikidata API to establish canonical entities
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-reconciliation:latest"
- **Inputs**: table_data_2.json from shared data directory
- **Outputs**: reconciled_table_2.json with Wikidata entity information
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay; retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Wikidata API, filesystem volume, Intertwino API, MongoDB database

### Save Final Supplier Data (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Exports validated supplier data to standardized CSV format
- **Executor**: Docker container with image "i2t-backendwithintertwino6-save:latest"
- **Inputs**: reconciled_table_2.json from shared data directory
- **Outputs**: enriched_data_2.csv file to shared data directory
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 1 attempt with 30-second delay; retries on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Filesystem volume, save service API, Intertwino API, MongoDB database

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-Level Parameters
- **name**: Identifier for the pipeline (default: "procurement_supplier_validation")
- **description**: Explanation of pipeline purpose
- **tags**: Classification tags including procurement, supplier-data, wikidata, data-validation

### Schedule Configuration
- Scheduling configuration is not explicitly defined with default values for all schedule parameters

### Execution Settings
- Pipeline-level retry policy with 1 retry attempt
- Other execution settings (max active runs, timeout, depends on past) use default values

### Component-Specific Parameters
- **Load Component**: DATASET_ID (integer, required), TABLE_NAME_PREFIX (string)
- **Reconciliation Component**: PRIMARY_COLUMN (string, required), RECONCILIATOR_ID (string, required), DATASET_ID (integer, required)
- **Save Component**: DATASET_ID (integer, required)

### Environment Variables
- **DATA_DIR**: Required shared directory path for component data exchange

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- **Filesystem**: Shared data directory for component communication
- **APIs**: Intertwino backend API, Wikidata reconciliation API
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Network**: Custom Docker network for component connectivity

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Sources**: suppliers.csv file, Wikidata public API
- **Sinks**: enriched_data_2.csv file, MongoDB collections
- **Intermediate Data**: JSON files and MongoDB collections for processing stages

### Authentication Methods
All connections utilize no authentication mechanisms.

### Data Lineage
Data flows from CSV files through JSON transformation and Wikidata reconciliation to final CSV export, with MongoDB providing persistent storage at each stage.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity with straightforward sequential processing but includes external API dependencies that introduce potential failure points.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components require successful completion of upstream dependencies with no timeout specifications.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Components implement consistent retry policies with single retry attempts and 30-second delays for network and timeout errors. No component-level timeout configurations are specified.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Wikidata API rate limiting (1 request per second) may impact performance
- Single retry policy may not adequately handle transient failures
- Network dependency on external Wikidata service introduces reliability concerns
- No explicit error handling for data validation failures

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

This pipeline's sequential structure and component-based design are compatible with major pipeline orchestration frameworks. The clear dependency chain and standardized component interfaces support implementation across different orchestration platforms. The Docker-based execution model and filesystem-based data sharing align with container-focused orchestration approaches.

## 8. Conclusion

The procurement supplier validation pipeline provides a structured approach to data quality improvement through automated supplier data reconciliation with Wikidata. Its component-based architecture facilitates maintainability and scalability while its sequential execution pattern ensures predictable data flow. The pipeline successfully addresses the business need for standardized supplier data but could benefit from enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms to improve robustness against external service failures.
