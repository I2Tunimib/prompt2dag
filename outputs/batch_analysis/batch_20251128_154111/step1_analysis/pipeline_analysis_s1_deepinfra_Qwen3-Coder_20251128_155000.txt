# Executive Sales Dashboard Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a sensor-gated workflow that waits for completion of an external daily sales aggregation process before proceeding with data loading and executive dashboard generation. The pipeline follows a linear sequential execution pattern with an upstream dependency sensor as the primary gating mechanism. The overall complexity is low to moderate, with three main components forming a straightforward data processing chain.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a sequential execution pattern with sensor-driven initiation. The flow begins with a sensor component that monitors external process completion, followed by two consecutive processing tasks that execute in strict sequence.

### Execution Characteristics
All pipeline components utilize Python-based execution environments. The sensor component operates in reschedule mode to optimize resource utilization during waiting periods.

### Component Overview
- **Sensor Component**: Monitors external DAG completion status to gate pipeline execution
- **Loader Component**: Processes and validates aggregated sales CSV data files
- **Transformer Component**: Generates executive dashboard visualizations from validated data

### Flow Description
The pipeline entry point is the sensor component that monitors external DAG completion. Upon successful detection of the upstream process completion, the loader component processes aggregated sales data from CSV files. Finally, the transformer component generates executive dashboard outputs. No branching or parallel execution paths are present.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Wait for Sales Aggregation (Sensor)
**Purpose and Category**: Gates pipeline execution until external daily sales aggregation process completes successfully.

**Executor Type and Configuration**: Python executor with reschedule mode enabled to release worker resources during waiting periods.

**Inputs and Outputs**: 
- Input: External DAG completion status via API connection
- Output: Sensor trigger signal to unlock downstream processing

**Retry Policy and Concurrency**: Maximum 2 retry attempts with 300-second delays. Retries on timeout and network errors only. No parallel execution support.

**Connected Systems**: API-based connection to monitor external DAG status with 60-second polling interval.

### Load Sales CSV (Loader)
**Purpose and Category**: Loads and validates aggregated sales CSV data produced by upstream processes.

**Executor Type and Configuration**: Python executor invoking load_aggregated_sales function.

**Inputs and Outputs**: 
- Input: Aggregated sales CSV files from filesystem (/data/sales/aggregated_{{ ds }}.csv)
- Output: Validated sales data objects for downstream processing

**Retry Policy and Concurrency**: Maximum 2 retry attempts with 300-second delays. Retries on file not found and validation errors. No parallel execution support.

**Connected Systems**: Filesystem connection for accessing aggregated sales data storage.

### Generate Executive Dashboard (Transformer)
**Purpose and Category**: Creates executive dashboard with sales metrics and visualizations using validated sales data.

**Executor Type and Configuration**: Python executor invoking generate_executive_dashboard function.

**Inputs and Outputs**: 
- Input: Validated sales data objects from loader component
- Output: Dashboard HTML files to filesystem (/dashboards/executive_{{ ds }}.html)

**Retry Policy and Concurrency**: Maximum 2 retry attempts with 300-second delays. Retries on rendering and data processing errors. No parallel execution support.

**Connected Systems**: Filesystem connection for storing generated dashboard outputs.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
Pipeline complexity is assessed as low with linear sequential execution and minimal branching logic. The primary complexity stems from the external dependency monitoring mechanism.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
The pipeline implements a strict success-based upstream policy requiring complete external DAG execution before proceeding. Timeout is configured at 3600 seconds with reschedule mode for resource optimization.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
All components implement consistent retry policies with maximum 2 attempts and 300-second delays. Sensor component includes specific timeout handling with 1-hour maximum wait period.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- External DAG dependency introduces potential failure points if upstream processes fail or timeout
- Single execution path creates sequential bottlenecks
- File-based I/O introduces potential filesystem access issues
- No parallel processing limits throughput optimization opportunities

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### Assessment for Major Platforms
The pipeline structure is compatible with major workflow orchestration platforms including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The sensor-driven pattern with sequential execution translates well across different orchestration frameworks.

### Pattern-Specific Considerations
The external task sensor pattern requires platform-specific implementations but maintains consistent behavioral expectations. The reschedule mode for sensor execution optimizes resource utilization across all platforms.

## 8. Conclusion

This pipeline successfully implements a reliable sensor-gated workflow for executive dashboard generation with clear data lineage and consistent error handling. The linear execution pattern provides predictable behavior while the external dependency monitoring ensures proper data freshness. The implementation demonstrates good practices in retry handling and resource optimization through reschedule mode usage. Future enhancements could consider parallel processing opportunities and more sophisticated monitoring capabilities.
