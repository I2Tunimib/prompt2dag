# Healthcare Claims ETL Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a staged ETL pattern for healthcare claims processing, featuring parallel extraction followed by sequential transformation and parallel loading stages. The pipeline orchestrates data flow from CSV sources through transformation and loading to analytics systems, concluding with BI dashboard refreshes. Key architectural patterns include hybrid flow with both sequential and parallel execution characteristics, demonstrating moderate complexity with five distinct components organized in a clear data processing sequence.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline implements a hybrid execution pattern combining parallel and sequential processing:
- Initial parallel extraction of claims and providers data
- Sequential transformation stage dependent on both extraction tasks
- Terminal parallel execution for data loading and BI refresh

### Execution Characteristics
All components utilize Python-based executors with consistent configuration patterns. No dynamic mapping or GPU resources are specified, indicating standard CPU-based processing requirements.

### Component Overview
The pipeline consists of five components organized into logical ETL categories:
- **Extractor** (2): Extract Claims Data, Extract Providers Data
- **Transformer** (1): Transform and Join Claims with Providers
- **Loader** (1): Load Data to Analytics Warehouse
- **Notifier** (1): Refresh BI Dashboards

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with two parallel entry points (extract_claims and extract_providers) that converge in the transform_join component. This transformation stage serves as the central processing hub, feeding results to both the data warehouse loader and BI refresh notifier in parallel. The architecture ensures data consistency through all_success upstream policies at each transition point.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Extract Claims Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Extracts patient claims data from CSV source file
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: claims.csv file from local filesystem connection
- **Outputs**: Extracted claims data object for downstream processing
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Local filesystem for CSV file access

### Extract Providers Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Extracts healthcare provider data from CSV source file
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: providers.csv file from local filesystem connection
- **Outputs**: Extracted providers data object for downstream processing
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Local filesystem for CSV file access

### Transform and Join Claims with Providers (Transformer)
- **Purpose**: Joins claims and provider data, anonymizes PII, and calculates risk scores
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: Claims and providers data objects from upstream extraction components
- **Outputs**: Transformed and joined data object for warehouse loading
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: No external system connections required

### Load Data to Analytics Warehouse (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Loads transformed data to healthcare_analytics.claims_fact and healthcare_analytics.providers_dim tables
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: Transformed joined data object from transformation stage
- **Outputs**: Claims fact and providers dimension tables in PostgreSQL database
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: PostgreSQL database connection for warehouse loading

### Refresh BI Dashboards (Notifier)
- **Purpose**: Refreshes Power BI and Tableau dashboards with latest data
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with default configuration
- **Inputs**: Warehouse load status from upstream loader component
- **Outputs**: BI refresh status confirmation
- **Retry Policy**: Maximum 2 attempts with 300-second delay, retrying on timeout and network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Power BI and Tableau API connections for dashboard refresh

## 4. Parameter Schema

### Pipeline-level Parameters
- **name**: Healthcare claims ETL pipeline identifier (default: healthcare_claims_etl)
- **description**: Comprehensive description of staged ETL processing
- **tags**: Classification tags including healthcare, claims, etl, staged_etl

### Schedule Configuration
- **enabled**: Daily execution scheduling enabled by default
- **cron_expression**: @daily execution pattern
- **start_date**: Execution begins January 1, 2024
- **catchup**: Missed intervals will not be executed retroactively
- **partitioning**: Daily data partitioning strategy

### Execution Settings
- **retry_policy**: Pipeline-level retry with 2 attempts and 5-minute delays
- **depends_on_past**: No dependency on previous run success

### Component-specific Parameters
- **extract_claims**: Source file path configuration for claims CSV
- **extract_providers**: Source file path configuration for providers CSV
- **transform_join**: PII anonymization and risk score calculation controls
- **load_warehouse**: Target schema and table name configurations

- **POWER_BI_CONN_ID**: Power BI service connection identifier
- **TABLEAU_CONN_ID**: Tableau service connection identifier

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- **Filesystem Connections**: Local file access for claims.csv and providers.csv
- **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL healthcare analytics database
- **API Connections**: Power BI and Tableau service endpoints with rate limiting

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Sources**: Claims CSV file with patient data, Providers CSV file with healthcare provider information
- **Sinks**: PostgreSQL database tables (claims_fact, providers_dim), Power BI dashboards, Tableau dashboards

### Authentication Methods
- **Database**: Basic authentication using environment variables for credentials
- **API Services**: OAuth tokens for Power BI, token-based authentication for Tableau

### Data Lineage
The pipeline maintains clear data lineage from CSV sources through intermediate datasets (claims_data, providers_data, transformed_claims_providers_joined) to final analytics tables and BI dashboards.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity with five well-defined components organized in a clear ETL pattern. The hybrid execution model balances parallel processing opportunities with necessary data dependencies.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
All components implement all_success upstream policies, ensuring data consistency and preventing downstream processing with incomplete or failed upstream data.

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Consistent retry policies across all components with 2 maximum attempts and 5-minute delays provide resilience against transient failures. No component-level timeout configurations are specified.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Single points of failure in transformation stage requiring both extraction tasks to succeed
- Rate limiting on BI service API connections may impact refresh performance
- No explicit data validation or quality checks documented in component specifications

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### Assessment for Major Platforms
The pipeline architecture translates well to major orchestration platforms including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The hybrid flow pattern with clear dependencies and consistent retry policies aligns with standard orchestration capabilities.

### Pattern-specific Considerations
- Parallel extraction pattern benefits from platforms supporting concurrent execution
- Sequential transformation dependencies require proper task ordering support
- API rate limiting considerations for BI refresh components may require platform-level rate limiting features

## 8. Conclusion

This healthcare claims ETL pipeline presents a well-structured implementation of staged data processing with clear separation of concerns across extraction, transformation, and loading stages. The architecture effectively leverages parallel processing where appropriate while maintaining data consistency through dependency management. The consistent configuration patterns and clear data lineage make this pipeline suitable for deployment across various orchestration platforms with minimal adaptation required.
