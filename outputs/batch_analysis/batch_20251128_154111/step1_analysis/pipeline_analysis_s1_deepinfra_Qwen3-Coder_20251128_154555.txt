# Data Quality Gate Pipeline Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This pipeline implements a data quality gate for customer CSV data, providing conditional routing based on quality assessment scores. The process ingests raw data, evaluates quality metrics, and routes data either to production systems or quarantine based on a 95% quality threshold.

The pipeline demonstrates moderate complexity with a hybrid execution pattern that combines sequential flow with conditional branching. Key architectural features include dual execution paths that converge at a final cleanup stage, supporting both successful data loading and quality issue handling scenarios.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### Flow Patterns
The pipeline employs a hybrid pattern combining:
- Sequential execution for the initial data ingestion and quality assessment phases
- Conditional branching based on quality scores to route data appropriately
- Convergent flow where both processing paths merge at a final cleanup component

### Execution Characteristics
All components utilize Python-based executors with consistent configuration patterns. HTTP executors are also present but not actively used in current component definitions.

### Component Overview
The pipeline consists of six distinct components organized into functional categories:
- Extractor: Ingests raw CSV data from filesystem sources
- QualityCheck: Evaluates data quality and determines routing decisions
- Loader: Handles high-quality data loading to production systems
- Reconciliator: Manages low-quality data quarantine and alert triggering
- Notifier: Sends email notifications for quality issues
- Other: Performs cleanup operations for temporary resources

### Flow Description
The pipeline begins with CSV data ingestion, followed by quality assessment that creates a branching decision point. High-quality data (≥95% score) flows to production loading, while low-quality data (<95% score) is quarantined and triggers alerts. Both paths converge at a final cleanup component that executes after all upstream processing completes.

## 3. Detailed Component Analysis

### Ingest CSV Data (Extractor)
- **Purpose**: Loads raw customer CSV data from source location for quality assessment
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: Raw CSV files from filesystem connection
- **Outputs**: File metadata for downstream quality assessment
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Filesystem connection for raw data access

### Data Quality Assessment (QualityCheck)
- **Purpose**: Calculates data quality score and determines routing path based on 95% threshold
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: File metadata from ingestion component
- **Outputs**: Branching decision for downstream routing
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: None

### Load High-Quality Data (Loader)
- **Purpose**: Loads high-quality data (≥95% score) to production database
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: Branching decision from quality assessment
- **Outputs**: Cleanup trigger signal
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Database connection for production data loading

### Quarantine Low-Quality Data (Reconciliator)
- **Purpose**: Quarantines low-quality data (<95% score) and triggers alert workflow
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: Branching decision from quality assessment
- **Outputs**: Quarantine action confirmation and alert trigger
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Filesystem connection for quarantine storage

### Send Quality Alert Email (Notifier)
- **Purpose**: Sends email notification to data stewards about quality issues
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: Alert trigger from quarantine component
- **Outputs**: Cleanup trigger signal
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: API connection for SMTP email service

### Cleanup Temporary Resources (Other)
- **Purpose**: Performs final cleanup operations for temporary files and resources
- **Executor**: Python-based execution with standard configuration
- **Inputs**: Cleanup triggers from both production loading and alert paths
- **Outputs**: Cleanup status information
- **Retry Policy**: Single attempt with 300-second delay on timeout or network errors
- **Connected Systems**: Filesystem connection for temporary file access

## 5. Integration Points

### External Systems and Connections
- Filesystem connections for raw data ingestion and quarantine storage
- Database connection for production data loading
- SMTP email service for alert notifications

### Data Sources and Sinks
- **Sources**: Raw customer CSV files from local filesystem
- **Sinks**: Production database, quarantine storage, email notifications

### Data Lineage
Clear data lineage from raw CSV files through quality assessment to either production systems or quarantine storage, with email notifications for quality issues.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Complexity Assessment
Moderate complexity with branching logic and multiple integration points. The conditional routing based on quality scores adds decision-making complexity while maintaining clear execution paths.

### Upstream Dependency Policies
Components follow standard dependency patterns:
- Initial ingestion has no upstream dependencies
- Quality assessment requires successful ingestion
- Branching components require successful quality assessment
- Cleanup waits for completion of both processing paths

### Retry and Timeout Configurations
Consistent retry policy across all components with single retry attempts and 300-second delays for timeout and network error scenarios.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Single retry policy may not be sufficient for transient failures
- Quality threshold is fixed at 95% without dynamic adjustment capability
- Cleanup component dependency on both paths could create bottlenecks
- No explicit timeout configurations at component level

## 7. Orchestrator Compatibility

### General Assessment
The pipeline architecture is compatible with major orchestrators including Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The component-based design with clear dependencies and conditional logic translates well across different orchestration platforms.

### Pattern-Specific Considerations
- Branching logic requires conditional execution support
- Convergent flow patterns need join/merge capabilities
- XCom-like data passing between components is essential
- Schedule configuration aligns with standard cron-based scheduling

## 8. Conclusion

This data quality gate pipeline provides a robust framework for conditional data processing based on quality metrics. The architecture effectively separates concerns between data ingestion, quality assessment, and conditional routing while maintaining clear execution paths and proper resource cleanup. The modular component design ensures maintainability and adaptability to different orchestration platforms while providing comprehensive error handling and monitoring capabilities.
