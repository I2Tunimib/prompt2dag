### Executive Summary

**Overall Purpose:**
The pipeline is designed to execute a series of Hive database operations for a COVID-19 real-time streaming data application. It follows a simple, sequential flow to ensure that the necessary system checks are performed before executing the Hive script.

**High-Level Flow:**
1. **Run System Check:** Executes a system command to identify the executing user context.
2. **Execute Hive Script:** Runs a multi-statement HiveQL script to create a database, a table, and insert test data.

**Key Patterns and Complexity:**
- **Pattern:** Sequential
- **Complexity:** Low (2/10)
- **Components:** 2 (Run System Check, Execute Hive Script)
- **Executors:** Bash, Hive

### Pipeline Architecture

**Flow Patterns:**
- **Sequential:** The pipeline follows a linear, sequential pattern where each component is executed in a strict order.
- **No Branching or Parallelism:** The pipeline does not include any branching or parallel execution paths.
- **No Sensors:** There are no sensor components that wait for external conditions.

**Execution Characteristics:**
- **Task Executor Types:** Bash, Hive

**Component Overview:**
- **Sensor:** Run System Check
- **SQLTransform:** Execute Hive Script

**Flow Description:**
- **Entry Points:** The pipeline starts with the "Run System Check" component.
- **Main Sequence:** The "Run System Check" component executes first, followed by the "Execute Hive Script" component.
- **Dependencies:** The "Execute Hive Script" component depends on the successful completion of the "Run System Check" component.

### Integration Points

**External Systems and Connections:**
- **Local System Shell:** Used by "Run System Check" for executing system commands.
  - **Type:** Filesystem
  - **Authentication:** None
- **Hive Local Database:** Used by "Execute Hive Script" for executing HiveQL scripts.
  - **Type:** Database
  - **Host:** localhost
  - **Port:** 10000
  - **Protocol:** JDBC
  - **Database:** mydb
  - **Authentication:** None

**Data Sources and Sinks:**
- **Sources:** Local system shell command output
- **Sinks:** Hive database 'mydb' and table 'mydb.test_af'
- **Intermediate Datasets:** System command output

### Implementation Notes

**Complexity Assessment:**
- The pipeline is relatively simple with a low complexity score of 2/10.
- It follows a straightforward, sequential pattern with no branching or parallelism.

**Upstream Dependency Policies:**
- The "Execute Hive Script" component depends on the successful completion of the "Run System Check" component.

**Retry and Timeout Configurations:**
- Both components have no retry attempts configured and no explicit timeout settings.

**Potential Risks or Considerations:**
- **System Context:** The "Run System Check" component relies on the local system shell, which may vary across different environments.
- **Hive Operations:** The "Execute Hive Script" component performs multiple database operations, which could fail if the Hive server is unavailable or the script contains errors.

### Orchestrator Compatibility

**Assessment for Airflow, Prefect, Dagster:**
- **Airflow:** The pipeline's sequential pattern and simple components are well-suited for Airflow. The lack of branching and parallelism simplifies the orchestration.
- **Prefect:** Prefect can handle the pipeline's linear flow and task dependencies effectively. The configuration of tasks and parameters is straightforward.
- **Dagster:** Dagster's support for sequential flows and task dependencies makes it a good fit for this pipeline. The simplicity of the components aligns well with Dagster's design principles.

**Pattern-Specific Considerations:**
- **Sequential Flow:** All orchestrators handle sequential flows efficiently, making the pipeline easy to implement and maintain.
- **No Branching or Parallelism:** The absence of branching and parallelism reduces the complexity and potential points of failure.

### Conclusion

The pipeline is a simple, sequential data processing pipeline designed to perform system checks and execute Hive database operations. It is well-suited for orchestrators that support linear flows and task dependencies, such as Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. The pipeline's low complexity and straightforward structure make it easy to implement and maintain.
