This code defines a Prefect 2.x flow named `analyze_transactions_pipeline` that follows the specified pipeline metadata and task dependencies. The flow is scheduled to run daily at midnight UTC and uses a concurrent task runner. Each task has error handling with retries set to 2. The connections/resources are loaded from Prefect blocks, and the tasks are executed in the specified order with proper dependencies.
